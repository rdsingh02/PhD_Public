Python – install from python.org/downloads 
Click on add to Path

Use Pip to install Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
  For ex: pip install pandas
  
For Geopandas, libraries – GDAL & Fiona is required
  Pip direct method doesn’t work
  We will download wheel file of GDAL first and then Fiona from Website: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/  
  Copy the location where the wheel file has been downloaded and use pip.
  Run a similar code on the command prompt: pip install C:\\Users\\----\\Downloads\\gdal-1.6.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
  Remember the GDAL and Fiona downloaded should be of the same version that you have your python installed.
